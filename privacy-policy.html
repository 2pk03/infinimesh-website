              <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
              <p>
                Like most website operators, infinimesh Inc. collects
                non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web
                browsers and servers typically make available, such as the
                browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date
                and time of each visitor request. infinimesh Inc.’s purpose in
                collecting non-personally identifying information is to better
                understand how infinimesh Inc.’s visitors use its website. From
                time to time, infinimesh Inc. may release
                non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g.,
                by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
              </p>
              <p>
                infinimesh Inc. also collects potentially personally-identifying
                information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in
                users and for users leaving comments on
                https://www.infinimesh.io blog posts. infinimesh Inc. only
                discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the
                same circumstances that it uses and discloses
                personally-identifying information as described below.
              </p>

              <br />
              <h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
              <p>
                Certain visitors to infinimesh Inc.’s websites choose to
                interact with infinimesh Inc. in ways that require infinimesh
                Inc. to gather personally-identifying information. The amount
                and type of information that infinimesh Inc. gathers depends on
                the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who
                sign up for a blog at https://www.infinimesh.io to provide a
                username and email address.
              </p>

              <h3>Security</h3>
              <p>

                to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal
                Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

                Policy covers the use of cookies by infinimesh Inc. and does not
